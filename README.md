Simulated Stock Exchange for Part IB Group Project
--
A group project where I helped build a stock exchange in which players can submit their own trading algorithms using our API and compete against each other to make the most profit. My contribution to the project was implementing an electronic market maker ensuring there was liquidity in the stock market and coding various bots trading in the background to simulate various market conditions on the stock exchange.
